<p style="border:4px solid #9BC546;padding:10px">In this section we will tell you what it means to host a Startup Live event. Based on this information you should be able to find out whether hosting the event is something that you would love to do.</p>
</p>

<h1 class="sectionedit1" id="your_motivation">1. Your Motivation</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
The <span class="wrap_em ">intrinsic motivation</span> of the host is the most important aspect whether an event becomes awesome or not. Thus, if you mainly aim to earn money with the event (which is of course also possible), this is probably not for you. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Here is a list of what our hosts typically motivates:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Supporting their local community</strong> to turn more innovative and promising new ideas into successful businesses</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Making a lasting impact in fostering entrepreneurship, innovation, and the <strong>creation of successful new start-ups</strong></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Building or supporting the start-up community in their region and change people’s lives</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Becoming <strong>part of an European-wide event series</strong> and international network of event ambassadors</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Benefiting from <strong>promoting their business / product in the community</strong> (e.g. you could get teams for your consulting or acceleration programs, your co-working space, or as future customers) </div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<span class="wrap_em ">Recognizing yourself in one or more of those points?</span> Great, then Startup Live is the ideal partner to help you achieve this fast, efficiently, and reliably!
</p>

<p>
With Startup Live, you do not have to create a new event from scratch, establish a cool event concept that has to tested, adapted and proven, and build a local community without reputation. You can reach your goals faster and easier with Startup Live, an European-wide brand that has a well-proven event format that helped to create a large number of successful start-ups.

<div class="level1">

<p>
<strong>Not 100% convinced yet and comparing Startup live with other event concepts?</strong> We often get asked about the difference to Startup Weekend. Let us go into more detail what makes Startup Live unique:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Take on a brand that stands for fresh thoughts, diversity, joy, excitement, and getting things done</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Event focus is on <strong>developing a business concept</strong>, not a working prototype (thus more business-oriented)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Flexible event format</strong> (2 vs. 3 days, new team formations vs. mature start-ups, all topics vs. topic focus)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Very limited number of events per year (around 20 in the near future), thus hosts have a <strong>high visibility and join an exclusive club of organizers</strong></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Be part of an <strong>European host and mentors network</strong> with yearly meet-ups in the near future</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Get <strong>exclusivity</strong> in your city, region, or country to host Startup Live events, which also gives you more leverage in acquiring financial sponsors</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Best teams from each event get <strong>direct access to financial investment opportunities</strong> through our partners CONDA and Pioneers</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Upon availability (we have a limited contingent per year) <strong>2 tickets for the Pioneers Festival</strong> for the winning team (worth 600 Euros per ticket)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Unique sales collaboration</strong> option: Hosts can sell our corporate packages and get an attractive commission. For example we organize special “themed” events for large companies. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Possibility to combine Startup Live event with <strong>preceding Pioneers Unplugged event</strong> to attract additional (technical) participants and negotiate a better sponsoring deal</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Teams that participate in Startup Live events get <strong>free access to the WhatAVenture tool</strong> from our partner WhatAVenture, an online tool that helps start-ups to improve their business model – scientifically proven to increase the success chance of a startup; <strong>printed working documents</strong> can already be used at the event to give teams guidance during the working sessions.</div>

</ul>

<!-- EDIT4 SECTION "4. Differentiation from Startup Weekend" [3935-6164] -->
<h1 class="sectionedit5" id="budget_calculation">6. Budget calculation</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
Now let’s talk about the financials, which is probably the part that scares most in the beginning. We can assure you that following our process <strong>you won’t have any financial risk with Startup Live!</strong> Moreover, with our guidelines you should never have a problem to sell a few sponsor packages that will even ensure a decent remuneration for all the working hours you put into the event.
</p>

<p>
<strong>But let&#039;s be clear about this: If you had to identify the 2 core pillars of event management, it is and will always be MARKETING AND SPONSORING!</strong> Not having someone in your team who is capable of approaching partners and raising sponsorship is a NO-GO. We do not want to run events without sponsoring raised. It could work to host a basic event just with ticketing income, but you will always be limited in what you can do. It is so much more fun and value in the event to have some partners on board. You will learn how to do sales and get well connected with companies in your region. Thus, this is a big opportunity for you.
</p>

<p>
<p style="border:4px solid #9BC546;padding:10px;text-align:center"><strong>We have a clear rule. Before we officially advertise the event (e.g. on the website), we ask you to raise initial sponsorship of 3.000 Euros!</strong> Only then you can be sure to cover the event cost and can host a high quality event.</p>
</p>

<p>
Yes, we know there are some regions in the world where it is nearly impossible to raise sponsorship. For those regions we can arrange special agreement to still make the event happen as we are also highly motivated to foster entrepreneurial spirit in those regions. You will find more details about this exception later.
</p>

<p>
<p style="border:4px solid #9BC546;padding:10px;text-align:center"><strong>BUT AGAIN: Event management consists of 30-40% raising sponsorships, and we expect from you this core task to be followed seriously.</strong></p> If you are committed and doing this for 2 months, you will be surprised by how much sponsoring (decent 5-digit number) you can raise in most parts of the world! If you do not have the sales expertise yourself, there are a lot of young, motivated people who LOVE to sell. Let them join your team.

Thorough planning is key to keeping your costs low. Of course if you organize the first event you might have more effort to find a good location, catering, photographer, etc. and thus probably have a higher cost than in following events.

<p>
As you can see it depends a lot if you get the 2 main cost factors, the location and the catering, sponsored or not. It is almost always possible to find a location that you can use for free in return for some sponsoring! There are always institutions which like to support such events. Often it can be a university. Besides, breakfast and beverages are also cost positions that are likely to get sponsored. You just have to do the job and approach breakfast providers, beverage brands, etc.

We will not fund any international events ourselves, so you still have to cover the event costs by yourself and the minimal ticket income. It is possible with a free location and basic catering.

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> We would love to have not just one event in your city, but 2 per year. We are strongly looking for hosts who want to organize this event on a regular basis and not just once.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Make sure you organize an awesome event by following our guidelines and recommended processes which were already applied more than 60 times in Europe; we save you a lot of time and thoughts on how to organize this event successfully.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A really good event has 60 to 80 participants! Not necessarily more, as the workshop format faces its limitations then (large teams, too many ideas). Focusing on quality instead of the number of participants is important. But it is possible to also have 100 participants if you follow our guidelines in the 3rd part of the Wiki. And of course less than 50 is also not good!</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If you have not attended a Startup Live event previously, we would like you to attend one of the upcoming events before hosting your own event (can already be during the planning phase).

<div class="level3">

<p>
Please go carefully through the contract draft that you&#039;ll find in the Attachments further below. Feel free to approach as via E-Mail or arrange a Skype call to discuss any contract details. We know there are many rules in there, but we need this to ensure a quality and process standard through all international events. Still, we are always open to discuss certain points individually.
</p>

<p>
The most important terms:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You need a legal entity (preferably from your country) to be able to raise sponsorship through a local bank account managed and owned by yourself. Any registered business entity should be fine. If you do not have one yet, remember that the registration will probably take some time. In case you do not want that, we offer you as one Add-on the opportunity to let us do the invoicing of the sponsorship and any event cost (e.g. catering, location). Please note that in this case all incoming invoices must be in German or English, and cleared in Euro.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> We take a 20 - 30 % share of the ticket income and a 20% share of the sponsoring income. This is necessary to sustain and grow the global Startup Live brand. The fee is still very low compared to other event series&#039;es and really the minimum that we can allow to still fund the global organization.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> In the contract you&#039;ll find a specification of the data we ask you to send to us after the event ended. Only when the data has been fully provided, we will release the ticket income.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You will also find the commission fee for selling our corporate packages.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Binding condition: This defines that you must raise sponsorship of 3.000 Euros before the event gets officially listed and promoted.</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<!-- EDIT18 SECTION "7.2 Terms" [18359-20054] -->
<h1 class="sectionedit19" id="time_schedule">8. Time schedule</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
To allow yourself enough time to prepare the best event possible, you should start at the latest 4 months before the event takes place. Starting even earlier obviously does not harm. If you have a good team setup of at least 3 people, the planning is not occupying you full-time but just some hours every week, sometimes more, sometimes less. The more experienced you are and the more often you run this event the less time everything will take you.

Ok, this was a lot of input, but we hope it gives you a much better understanding what it takes to organize such an event. Of course for every step we will provide you with guidelines, templates and ready documents that will make the event organization as easy as possible for you. Let&#039;s see if you are ready to go:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Everything clear about the event format?</div>

</ul>

<p>
<strong>What companies can you target?</strong>
</p>
<div class="table sectionedit25"><table class="inline">
	<tr class="row0">
		<th class="col0"> GOLD </th><td class="col1"> Consulting companies (tax, strategy, law, etc.), any companies that want to provide a mentor, VCs / incubators or similar “investors” who want to be in the jury </td>

	</tr>
	<tr class="row2">
		<th class="col0"> DIAMOND </th><td class="col1"> Mainly large corporations or possibly an accelerator </td>
	</tr>
</table></div>
<!-- EDIT25 TABLE [24236-24542] -->
<p>
<strong>Why did we provide a pricing range for PLATINUM and DIAMOND?</strong>
Because you always have to consider the individual needs of the company. Do not take the packages for granted. It helps to quickly arrange preferences with the potential sponsor in a sales meeting, but not everyone wants a speech or be in the press release. Maybe something that we do not have on the list. You can then easily exchange them and find an agreement. Listen to your customer needs is always very important.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Final thoughts before you go out there and sell:</strong>
Think about the sustainability. It’s always good to document the contacts and calls you have made. If anything changes and another person has to do the sponsoring part, they should have an overview of the contacts. We don’t have to reinvent the wheel for every Startup Live, if we work sustainable. Remember that in the end you should send us the data of the final sponsors. Also when you host the next event you already have a history of your sales effort.
In the 2nd part of this Wiki, we will also provide you with an Excel sheet where you can document all your planning activities.
</p>

<p>
<strong>How do you approach potential sponsors?</strong>
</p>

<p>
It would be too much asked of us to teach you how to do sales, but here are some general guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> It is always good to use your network first. Maybe someone in your team has worked at an interesting company before?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Cold calling also often works quite well. The phone should be your best friend anyway when talking to sponsors.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> E-Mail should only be your 3rd or 4th option with the request to schedule a call or meeting.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Then always schedule a meeting with the right person in the company. You sell through emotions and connection, not through E-Mail.</div>
</li>
</ul>
