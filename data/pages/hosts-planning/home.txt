====== Sponsoring ====== 

Sales pitch:
contact austauschen
Event facts slide 12 anpassen
Ggf. Sponsoring preise anpassen

Always print the ppt with … to have best quality

do not mix HR, speed dating, etc. just to acquire sponsors
je nach eventformat anderes sponsorship

====== Marketing ====== 

1) Spend around 200 Euros Facebook marketing that drives attendees directly to your facebook event
2) Make sure you have at least 100 “going” 4 weeks before the event and 200 “going 2 weeks before the event
3) Do regular Facebook postings according to our guidelines
4) Use the following marketing channels: universities (projects), partners that promote, facebook groups and partner pages, press releases

| Team (3 or 4 people) – Early bird| Only until 3 weeks before the event	| 39 €|

In general you can always use promo codes with a 20% discount, especially give this to all your partners that promote within their community
You should rarely lower to more than 20% and not arbitrarily set different discounts (20% for partner A, 50% for partner B); Remember that the ticket prices we suggest represent the value of the event (catering etc…), you should not sell your tickets too cheap!
You can have 1 or 2 gewinnspiele, and selected promotion activities (just one day validity!) with a 50% discount, especially in the “Normal” phase
