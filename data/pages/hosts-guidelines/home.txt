In this section we will tell you what it means to host a Startup Live event. Based on this information you should be able to decide whether to become a host or not.

====== Your profile, motivation and benefits ======

The intrinsic motivation of the host is the most important aspect whether an event becomes awesome or not. Thus, if you mainly aim to earn money with the event (which is of course also possible), this is probably not for you. Here is what our hosts motivates:
  * Supporting their local community to turn more innovative and promising new ideas into successful businesses
  * Making a lasting impact in fostering entrepreneurship, innovation, and the creation of successful new start-ups
  * Building or supporting the start-up community in your region and change people’s lives
  * Becoming part of an European-wide event series and international network of event ambassadors
  * Recognize yourself in one or more of those points? Great, then Startup Live is the ideal partner to help you achieve this fast, efficiently, and reliably.


Promoting ur product etc in our community . I could be an accelerator, co-working space.


With Startup Live, you do not have to create a new …, establish a new concept that has to tested and proven, and build a community without a standing. You can reach your goals faster and easier with Startup Live, an European-wide brand that has a well-proven event format that helped to create a large number of successful start-ups.
Motivation is the one side, and capabilities are the other. You should bring confidence and experience to handle the following key activities as host:
  * Excellent event management skills to realize an awesome Startup Live event
  * Acquire sponsors to cover the event costs
  * Build a team that helps me organize the event
  * Invite top-class mentors, speakers, and moderator from your region
  * You recognize yourself in that description?  Perfect, then let’s move on.

====== What you get from us ======

  * The right to use the brand of Startup Live
  * Access to all information and know-how that is necessary to conduct an awesome event
  * Marketing material, official opening presentation, checklists, event planning support
  * Website and ticketing solution

sales commission + exclusivity as future options
====== Differentiation from Startup Weekend ======

  * Event focus is on developing a business concept, not a working prototype
  * Flexible event format (2 vs. 3 days, new team formations vs. mature start-ups, all topics vs. topic focus)
  * Less rigid terms and restrictions
  * Very limited number of events per year (around 20 in the near future), thus hosts have a high visibility and join an exclusive club of organizers
  * Be part of an European host and mentors network with yearly meet-ups in the near future
  * Get exclusivity in your city, region, or country to host Startup Live events, which also gives you more leverage in acquiring financial sponsors
  * Take on a brand that stands for fresh thoughts, diversity, joy, excitement, and getting things done
  * Best teams from each event get direct access to financial investment opportunities through our partners CONDA and Pioneers
  * Upon availability (we have a limited contingent per year) 2 tickets for the Pioneers Festival for the winning team (worth 600 Euros per ticket)
  * Unique collaborations with corporates: On top, hosts can become a seller of our corporate packages and get an attractive commission. For example we organize special “themed” events for large companies. 
  * Possibility to combine Startup Live event with preceding Pioneers Unplugged event to attract additional (technical) participants 
  * Teams that participate in Startup Live events get free access to the WhatAVenture tool from our partner WhatAVenture, an online tool that help start-ups to improve their business model – scientifically proven to increase the success chance of a startup; printed working documents can already be used at the event to give teams guidance during the working sessions.
  * Amazing feedback from previous hosts and great success stories prove the efficiency of our event format 

====== The budget ======

Now let’s talk about the financials. With Startup Live you won’t have any financial risk! You never have to worry about covering your cost if you follow our process. Moreover, with our guidelines you should never have a problem to sell a few sponsor packages that will even ensure a decent remuneration for all the working hours you put into the event.

===== The costs =====
Thorough planning is key to keeping your costs low. Of course for the first event you will have more effort to find a good location, catering, photographer, etc.

For the working time of yourself and your team, we take 15 Euros per hour as basis of the calculation, as the income should not be your top priority; you have intrinsic motivation to do this event! Still you should get a decent compensation for all the work if you do a good job. For the hours at the event we calculate with 0 Euros, as this is your event, so you should enjoy it and not see it as ROI component.

===== Costs - conclusions =====

  - If you are ok with getting out of the event with no earnings for your team, you can organize an event with costs of just 3.000 Euros. The key is to find a location that can be used for free. This is normally not difficult, as there are always organizations and institutions who like to offer their location in return for a small branding package and the chance to join the event with some representatives. The same goes for the catering: you can find sponsors that cover a significant share of the cost. And keep it simple: participants focus on working and do not need a five-star menu!
  - With a budget of 8.000 Euros you are able to host already a really good event without any financial worries. With that amount you can provide good catering, have a decent marketing budget, can even fly in some international mentors, pay a small remuneration to a photographer or moderator, and of course keep some of the earnings for your team.
  - In case you are a true seller and innovator, you can organize an extraordinary event. This is far from needed and especially not recommended for first-timers. It is only possible with raising a lot of sponsoring deals (add here: charge more, better line-up, etc. leads to …)


so yes, serious event business is not just starting a Facebook event and share it. One key skill is raising sponsorship and this is something you must do if you want to become a host. Otherwise get someone in your team with sales experience or leave it...
