<html><br><span style="font-size:36px"></html>''PHASE 1 - THE PRE-ARRANGEMENT''<html></span><br><br></html>

<html><p style="border:4px solid #9BC546;padding:10px"></html>In this section we will tell you what it means to host a Startup Live event. Based on this information you should be able to find out whether hosting the event is something that you would love to do.<html></p></html>

====== 1. Your Motivation ======

The <wrap em>intrinsic motivation</wrap> of the host is the most important aspect whether an event becomes awesome or not. Thus, if you mainly aim to earn money with the event (which is of course also possible), this is probably not for you. 

**Here is a list of what our hosts typically motivates:**
  * **Supporting their local community** to turn more innovative and promising new ideas into successful businesses
  * Making a lasting impact in fostering entrepreneurship, innovation, and the **creation of successful new start-ups**
  * Building or supporting the start-up community in their region and change people’s lives
  * Becoming **part of an European-wide event series** and international network of event ambassadors
  * Benefiting from **promoting their business / product in the community** (e.g. you could get teams for your consulting or acceleration programs, your co-working space, or as future customers) 

<wrap em>Recognizing yourself in one or more of those points?</wrap> Great, then Startup Live is the ideal partner to help you achieve this fast, efficiently, and reliably!

With Startup Live, you do not have to create a new event from scratch, establish a cool event concept that has to tested, adapted and proven, and build a local community without reputation. You can reach your goals faster and easier with Startup Live, an European-wide brand that has a well-proven event format that helped to create a large number of successful start-ups.

====== 2. Your Profile ======

Motivation is the one side, and capabilities are the other. You should bring confidence and experience to **handle the following key activities as host**:

  * Excellent **event management skills** to realize an awesome Startup Live event
  * **Acquire sponsors** to at least cover the event costs
  * **Build a team** that helps me organize the event
  * **Marketing**, Marketing, Marketing
  * **Invite top-class mentors, speakers, and moderator** from your region

<wrap em>You recognize yourself in that description?</wrap> **Perfect, then let’s move on! :-)**

====== 3. What you get from us ======

  * The right to **use the brand of Startup Live** and privilege for hosting further events in your city for 1 year
  * **Access to all information and know-how** that is necessary to conduct an awesome event
  * **Templates:** Marketing material, sales decks, official opening presentation, checklists, event planning support, others (everything in English!)
  * **Website and ticketing** solution
  * **Access to our network** of international mentors, moderators, and speakers
  * **Host buddy** from our pool of previous hosts (upon availability)
  * Winning team qualifies for getting **2 Pioneers Tickets** for upcoming Pioneers Festival from our yearly contingent (each ticket worth 600 Euros). (If we have more winning teams than tickets we randomly assign the available tickets)
  * A **dedicated person from us** that is available for consultation
  * Exposure in the **media and our European community of 25000+ people** (press releases, website, social media, newsletter) and 500+ unique website visitors per day
  * Future host **exclusivity option** for your city, region, or even country
  * The option to **book Add-ons** (e.g. event facilitator from our team, moderator, operational support)

<wrap em>AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST A VERY UNIQUE EXTRA INCENTIVE:</wrap>
You can sell our global event packages to companies and get an attractive commission for it. More about it later.
====== 4. Differentiation from Startup Weekend ======

**Not 100% convinced yet and comparing Startup live with other event concepts?** We often get asked about the difference to Startup Weekend. Let us go into more detail what makes Startup Live unique:

  * Take on a brand that stands for fresh thoughts, diversity, joy, excitement, and getting things done
  * Event focus is on **developing a business concept**, not a working prototype (thus more business-oriented)
  * **Flexible event format** (2 vs. 3 days, new team formations vs. mature start-ups, all topics vs. topic focus)
  * Very limited number of events per year (around 20 in the near future), thus hosts have a **high visibility and join an exclusive club of organizers**
  * Be part of an **European host and mentors network** with yearly meet-ups in the near future
  * Get **exclusivity** in your city, region, or country to host Startup Live events, which also gives you more leverage in acquiring financial sponsors
  * Best teams from each event get **direct access to financial investment opportunities** through our partners CONDA and Pioneers
  * Upon availability (we have a limited contingent per year) **2 tickets for the Pioneers Festival** for the winning team (worth 600 Euros per ticket)
  * **Unique sales collaboration** option: Hosts can sell our corporate packages and get an attractive commission. For example we organize special “themed” events for large companies. 
  * Possibility to combine Startup Live event with **preceding Pioneers Unplugged event** to attract additional (technical) participants and negotiate a better sponsoring deal
  * Teams that participate in Startup Live events get **free access to the WhatAVenture tool** from our partner WhatAVenture, an online tool that helps start-ups to improve their business model – scientifically proven to increase the success chance of a startup; **printed working documents** can already be used at the event to give teams guidance during the working sessions.

Again and again we get amazing feedback from previous hosts and hear great success stories from previous participants. What are you waiting for? <wrap em>Get part of the coolest European start-up factory!</wrap>
====== 6. Budget calculation ======

Now let’s talk about the financials, which is probably the part that scares most in the beginning. We can assure you that following our process **you won’t have any financial risk with Startup Live!** Moreover, with our guidelines you should never have a problem to sell a few sponsor packages that will even ensure a decent remuneration for all the working hours you put into the event.

**But let's be clear about this: If you had to identify the 2 core pillars of event management, it is and will always be MARKETING AND SPONSORING!** Not having someone in your team who is capable of approaching partners and raising sponsorship is a NO-GO. We do not want to run events without sponsoring raised. It could work to host a basic event just with ticketing income, but you will always be limited in what you can do. It is so much more fun and value in the event to have some partners on board. You will learn how to do sales and get well connected with companies in your region. Thus, this is a big opportunity for you.

<html><p style="border:4px solid #9BC546;padding:10px;text-align:center"></html>**We have a clear rule. Before we officially advertise the event (e.g. on the website), we ask you to raise initial sponsorship of 3.000 Euros!** Only then you can be sure to cover the event cost and can host a high quality event.<html></p></html>

Yes, we know there are some regions in the world where it is nearly impossible to raise sponsorship. For those regions we can arrange special agreement to still make the event happen as we are also highly motivated to foster entrepreneurial spirit in those regions. You will find more details about this exception later.

<html><p style="border:4px solid #9BC546;padding:10px;text-align:center"></html>**BUT AGAIN: Event management consists of 30-40% raising sponsorships, and we expect from you this core task to be followed seriously.**<html></p></html> If you are committed and doing this for 2 months, you will be surprised by how much sponsoring (decent 5-digit number) you can raise in most parts of the world! If you do not have the sales expertise yourself, there are a lot of young, motivated people who LOVE to sell. Let them join your team.

===== 6.1 Cost Calculation =====
Thorough planning is key to keeping your costs low. Of course if you organize the first event you might have more effort to find a good location, catering, photographer, etc. and thus probably have a higher cost than in following events.

==== 6.1.1 Fix Cost ====

**Here are 3 typical cost structures depending how much sponsoring you have raised before:**

^ Fix cost    ^ Basic<html>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</html>      ^ Normal<html>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</html>          ^ High-class<html>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</html>  ^ Comment ^ 
^ Buffet    | 1.500 €         | 2.500 €        | 3.500 € | Try to get it sponsored!! |
^ Location| 0 €        | 0 €        | 3.000 € | Try to get it sponsored!! |
^ Print material | 500 €         | 500 €        | 1.000 € | Try to get it sponsored!! |
^ Online marketing | 200 €         | 500 €        | 1.000 € |  |
^ Moderator | 0 €         | 500 €        | 2.000 € | Try not to save money here, a good moderator is important! |
^ Photographer | 0 €         | 200 €        | 500 € |  |
^ Video | 0 €         | 0 €        | 5.000 € | Video coverage is optional, if you have enough sponsoring income you can do this |
^ Travel expenses | 0 €         | 600 €        | 6000 € | Maximum of 2 international mentors |
^ Mentors - remuneration | 0 €         | 0 €        | 2.000 € | Mentors should participate for free. You can pay up to 4 "high-class" mentors if necessary |
^ Other expenses | 0 €         | 300 €        | 500 € | Example: transport costs |
^ TOTAL ^2.200 €         ^5.100 €        ^19.100 € ^ ^

As you can see it depends a lot if you get the 2 main cost factors, the location and the catering, sponsored or not. It is almost always possible to find a location that you can use for free in return for some sponsoring! There are always institutions which like to support such events. Often it can be a university. Besides, breakfast and beverages are also cost positions that are likely to get sponsored. You just have to do the job and approach breakfast providers, beverage brands, etc.

==== 6.1.2 HR Cost ==== 
 
For the working time of yourself and your team, we take 15 Euros per hour as basis of the calculation. Why? As the income should not be your top priority, and you have intrinsic motivation to do this event! Still, when you do a good organization job, you should get a decent compensation for all the work. For the hours of work at the event we calculated with 0 Euros, as this is your event, so you should enjoy it and not see it as financial return component.

^ HR cost    ^ Hours ^ Basic<html>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</html>      ^ Normal<html>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</html>          ^ High-class<html>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</html>  ^ Comment ^ 
^ Project / event management | 50 | 750 €         | 750 €        | 975 € | Team coordination, planning & tracking activities, finding location, catering, etc. |
^ Sales (sponsors) | 50 | 750 €         | 750 €        | 975 € |  |
^ Acquire and on-board mentors | 16 | 240 €         | 240 €        | 312 € | |
^ Design | 8 | 120 €         | 120 €        | 156 € | Flyer, marketing |
^ Marketing & PR | 56 | 840 €         | 840 €        | 1092 € | Incl. website updates, social media marketing, scouting and contacting start-ups and talents |
^ Onsite during the 3 days | 200 | 0 €         | 0 €        | 0 € | Team of at least 5 people to run event, but this is your event and you should ENJOY it |
^ Aftercare | 16 | 240 €         | 240 €        | 312 € | PR, documentation, etc. |
^ TOTAL ^ 396 ^ 2940 €        ^ 2940 €         ^ 3822 € ^  ^ 

[Note: For the high-class scenario we simply calculated with a factor of 1.2 as you probably put some more hours into the event when you raised more sponsoring and then also do more on how to use it (e.g. organize a video coverage).]
==== 6.1.3 Conclusions ====

  - If you are OK with getting out of the event with no earnings for your team, **you can organize an event with costs of just 3.000 Euros or even less**. The key is to find a location that can be used for free. This is normally not difficult, as there are always organizations and institutions who like to offer their location in return for a small branding package and the chance to join the event with some representatives. The same goes for the catering: you can find sponsors that cover a significant share of the cost. And keep it simple: participants focus on working and do not need a five-star menu!
  - **With a budget of 8.000 Euros you are able to host a really good event without any financial worries.** With that amount you can provide good catering, have a decent marketing budget, can even fly in some international mentors, pay a small remuneration to a photographer or moderator, and of course keep some of the earnings for your team.
  - In case you are a true seller and innovator, you can organize an extraordinary event. This is far from needed and especially not recommended for first-timers. It is only possible with raising a lot of sponsoring deals and having a great group of (international) mentors so you can justify high ticket prices.




===== 6.2 Income calculation =====

Now let’s take a look how we raise the budget of 3.000 Euros to 8.000 Euros.
Of course later on we will provide you with details about the sponsoring packages "Diamond", "Platinum", and "Gold" with a ready-made sales deck that can present to potential sponsors.

^ Income source^ Basic ^ Normal ^ High-class  ^ 
^ Ticket sales| 1.200 €         | 2.000 €        | 3.200 € | 
^ Local grant| 0 €         | 0 €        | 1.600 € (1x) | 
^ Diamond partner| 0 €         | 0 €        | 8.000 € (1x) | 
^ Platinum partner| 0 €         | 4.800 € (1x)        | 8.000 € (2x) | 
^ Gold partner | 2.400 € (2x)         | 2.400 € (2x)        | 3.600 € (3x) | 
^ TOTAL^ 3.600 € ^ 9.200 € ^ 24.400 €  ^ 

[Note: The share of the income that Startup Live will receive at the end is already deducted! More about that later.]

==== 6.2.1 Conclusions ====

  -   Basic: With **just 2 small sponsoring packages of 1.500 Euros** each and a very conservative number for the ticket income of 1.500 Euros (you will probably earn more), you already have more than enough to finance a decent event with a sponsored location. It will never be a problem to find a few partners who are willing to sponsor such a small sum!
  -   Normal: So every additional sponsor that you get on board is in most cases already money that you can either use to increase the quality of the event or pay-out to your team. **A budget of 9.200 Euro is the average income a typical Startup Live event can raise in a typical sales phase of 2 months.** As you can see, you just need 1 Platinum partner, who agrees to a bigger branding package worth 6.000 Euros, to achieve this. Think of all the big companies out there, for them this number is peanuts.
  -   High-class: This is definitely not possible in every city and requires a high sales effort, but it is possible and we've done it year after year in Austria and Germany. It does not necessarily need to be a large city. Especially in cities where the start-up landscape is nearly not existing yet, many organizations just wait for an event like this to be born and be part of! Still, "Diamond" partners are hard to get and will not always be possible to find.
===== 6.2.2 Regional Exceptions ====

You believe or know that in your city sponsoring and high ticket prices are really not possible? Ok, we know there are some areas especially in MENA regions where this can be the case. We still try to help you to make this possible and potentially clarify your city as "sponsored", meaning you do not have to adhere to the 3.000 Euros sponsoring rule and get a special contract from us. To qualify for this, we need confirmation for:
  - Significant, documented proof that sponsoring is not possible in your city or region
  - The average wage in your city is so low that ticket prices must be really low in order to get participants

We will not fund any international events ourselves, so you still have to cover the event costs by yourself and the minimal ticket income. It is possible with a free location and basic catering.
====== 7. Host Agreement ======
==== 7.1 Expectations ====

  * We would love to have not just one event in your city, but 2 per year. We are strongly looking for hosts who want to organize this event on a regular basis and not just once.
  * Make sure you organize an awesome event by following our guidelines and recommended processes which were already applied more than 60 times in Europe; we save you a lot of time and thoughts on how to organize this event successfully.
  * A really good event has 60 to 80 participants! Not necessarily more, as the workshop format faces its limitations then (large teams, too many ideas). Focusing on quality instead of the number of participants is important. But it is possible to also have 100 participants if you follow our guidelines in the 3rd part of the Wiki. And of course less than 50 is also not good!
  * Represent the brand and reputation of Startup Live in the best possible way!
  * Please always let us know when you have ideas and suggestions to improve things, we are always open to adapt our concepts and solutions. For instance if you made cooler badges than we currently have we are happy to share them with us and our other hosts.
  * If you have not attended a Startup Live event previously, we would like you to attend one of the upcoming events before hosting your own event (can already be during the planning phase). If this is not possible, we can demand to have one of our team members to assist as facilitator at the event. In that case his or her travel expenses must be covered by the event budget.

==== 7.2 Terms ====

Please go carefully through the contract draft that you'll find in the Attachments further below. Feel free to approach as via E-Mail or arrange a Skype call to discuss any contract details. We know there are many rules in there, but we need this to ensure a quality and process standard through all international events. Still, we are always open to discuss certain points individually.

The most important terms:
  * You need a legal entity (preferably from your country) to be able to raise sponsorship through a local bank account managed and owned by yourself. Any registered business entity should be fine. If you do not have one yet, remember that the registration will probably take some time. In case you do not want that, we offer you as one Add-on the opportunity to let us do the invoicing of the sponsorship and any event cost (e.g. catering, location). Please note that in this case all incoming invoices must be in German or English, and cleared in Euro.
  * We take a 20 - 30 % share of the ticket income and a 20% share of the sponsoring income. This is necessary to sustain and grow the global Startup Live brand. The fee is still very low compared to other event series'es and really the minimum that we can allow to still fund the global organization.
  * In the contract you'll find a specification of the data we ask you to send to us after the event ended. Only when the data has been fully provided, we will release the ticket income.
  * You will also find the commission fee for selling our corporate packages.
  * Binding condition: This defines that you must raise sponsorship of 3.000 Euros before the event gets officially listed and promoted.

====== 8. Time schedule ======

To allow yourself enough time to prepare the best event possible, you should start at the latest 4 months before the event takes place. Starting even earlier obviously does not harm. If you have a good team setup of at least 3 people, the planning is not occupying you full-time but just some hours every week, sometimes more, sometimes less. The more experienced you are and the more often you run this event the less time everything will take you.

**Here is an overview of your main duties over time:**

^ When<html>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</html>  ^ Main tasks<html>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</html> ^ Milestones ^

====== 9. Checklist ======

Ok, this was a lot of input, but we hope it gives you a much better understanding what it takes to organize such an event. Of course for every step we will provide you with guidelines, templates and ready documents that will make the event organization as easy as possible for you. Let's see if you are ready to go:

  * Everything clear about the event format?
  * Team complete?
  * Time schedule set?
  * Business entity available?
  * And of course contract signed and sent back to a representative of Startup Live?

Awesome! Then let's get some cool sponsors on board!

====== 10. Sponsoring ======

In the attachment you can find a nearly finished Sales Deck.

<WRAP center round tip 60%>
Mak sure sure you install the font "Museo" before you open the presentation. This is our CI font and we use it in all our documents.
</WRAP>

**You need to adapt the following parts to your needs:**
  * Slide 12: Put here your event data and logos
  * Slide 14: You might want to adapt the packages to your local market
  * Slide 18: Put here your contact data

**Further remarks:**
  * Slide 15: In case a company gets interested in the "THING BIG" packages, approach as to discuss details and the further steps.
  * Of course you can also change other parts of the deck. The packages from COPPER to DIAMOND are well defined and reflect what most companies chose and wanted over the years. You might want to adapt the prices to your local market.

**What companies can you target?**
|^ GOLD | Consulting companies (tax, strategy, law, etc.), any companies that want to provide a mentor, VCs / incubators or similar "investors" who want to be in the jury |
|^ PLATINUM | Any company that sees the event as marketing tool |
|^ DIAMOND | Mainly large corporations or possibly an accelerator |

**Why did we provide a pricing range for PLATINUM and DIAMOND?**
Because you always have to consider the individual needs of the company. Do not take the packages for granted. It helps to quickly arrange preferences with the potential sponsor in a sales meeting, but not everyone wants a speech or be in the press release. Maybe something that we do not have on the list. You can then easily exchange them and find an agreement. Listen to your customer needs is always very important.

**Final thoughts before you go out there and sell:**
Think about the sustainability. It’s always good to document the contacts and calls you have made. If anything changes and another person has to do the sponsoring part, they should have an overview of the contacts. We don’t have to reinvent the wheel for every Startup Live, if we work sustainable. Remember that in the end you should send us the data of the final sponsors. Also when you host the next event you already have a history of your sales effort.
In the 2nd part of this Wiki, we will also provide you with an Excel sheet where you can document all your planning activities.

**How do you approach potential sponsors?**

It would be too much asked of us to teach you how to do sales, but here are some general guidelines:
  * It is always good to use your network first. Maybe someone in your team has worked at an interesting company before?
  * Cold calling also often works quite well. The phone should be your best friend anyway when talking to sponsors.
  * E-Mail should only be your 3rd or 4th option with the request to schedule a call or meeting.
  * Then always schedule a meeting with the right person in the company. You sell through emotions and connection, not through E-Mail.

<wrap em>MAY YOU DO WELL! :-)</wrap>
